## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
# For generating the hash
library(digest) 

# For copying to clipboard
library(clipr)       

# The string to hash
input_string <- ""

# Generate the hash using SHA-256
hash_hex <- digest(input_string, algo = "sha256", serialize = FALSE)

# Declare a variable with only a quarter of the resulting hash
quarter_hash <- substr(hash_hex, 1, nchar(hash_hex) %/% 4)

# Save the result to the clipboard
write_clip(quarter_hash)

# Optional: Print the quarter hash
cat ("Quarter hash copied to clipboard:",quarter_hash,"\n")

```
