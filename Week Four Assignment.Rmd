<!-- **Assignment 4: -->

<!-- Assignment – Tidying and Transforming Data  -->
<!-- Source:  Numbersense, Kaiser Fung, McGraw Hill, 2013  -->
<!-- The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations.  Your task is to:  -->

<!-- (1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.   -->
<!-- You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so  -->
<!-- that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.  -->
<!-- (2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy  -->
<!-- and transform your data.    -->
<!-- (3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.  -->
<!-- (4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative  -->
<!-- descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions.  Please include in your  -->
<!-- homework submission:  -->
<!--   The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and   -->
<!--  The URL for your rpubs.com web page. -->

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

 


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# connect to Azure database

```{r}

# Creating connection


mysqldbTBConn = dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),
                            dbname= 'md.asaduzzaman39',
                            host= 'cunydata607sql.mysql.database.azure.com',
                            port=3306,
                            user='md.asaduzzaman39',
                            password='c1706f410226ffca')
dbListTables(mysqldbTBConn)

```


# read table's data from Azure database(table called airline_data)

```{r fetch data from azure database}
result = dbSendQuery(mysqldbTBConn, "select * from airline_data")
data <- fetch(result)

print(data)

```

# Analysis

#used na.omit function to remove values
# filled airline_name used previous values.
# used gather function gather key pair values
#used mutate function rename variable
# used spread function spread the data
#Calculate the deay rate.

```{r}
data <- na.omit(data) %>%
  mutate(airline_name = na_if(airline_name,'')) %>%
 # fill(airline_name, .direction = 'up')
  fill(airline_name, .direction = 'down') %>%
  gather('Location','flight', 3:7) %>%
   mutate(status = str_replace(status, 'on time','On_time'),
          status = str_replace(status, 'delayed','Delayed')) %>%
   spread(status, flight)%>%
  mutate(flight = Delayed+On_time, delay_rate= Delayed/ (Delayed+On_time))

 data 

```

(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.


```{r}
Delays_data <- data %>%
  select(airline_name, flight, Delayed, On_time) %>%
  group_by(airline_name) %>%
  summarize(Delayed = sum(Delayed), Flight = sum(flight), Delay.Rate = sum(Delayed)/sum(flight))
Delays_data
```

# plot two  graphs to see the total flight by airline and delay rate by airline


```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = Delays_data, aes(x=airline_name, y=Flight, fill=airline_name))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  ggtitle('Total Flights by Air Line')+
  geom_text(aes(label=Flight),vjust=-0.5, hjust=0.5)

plot2 <- ggplot(data = Delays_data, aes(x=airline_name, y=Delayed, fill=airline_name))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  ggtitle('Delay Rate by Air Line')+
   geom_text(aes(label=percent(Delay.Rate)),vjust=-0.5, hjust=0.5)
   

ggarrange(plot1,plot2)
 
```
Conclusions: Overall Alaska  Airline had 3775 flights, and delayed rate is 13.3% and AM West Airline had 7225 flights,and delayed rate is 10.9% but We compare the flight's delay rate of the airline by destinations(cities). Alaska airline flights have better performence than AM West. So it is better to fly with Alaska airline's flight.
